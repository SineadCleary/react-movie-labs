## API endpoints.

+ Top Rated page - /topRated

## Independent learning

+ I attempted to include pagination, however it does not fully work. When changing page the listed movies do not change to reflect the change in page. (src/components/templateMovieListPage/index.js)
+ Used MUI Tabs in header (src/components/siteHeader/index.js)
+ Online references: https://mui.com/material-ui/
